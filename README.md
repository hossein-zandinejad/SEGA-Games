## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Analysis

- **File**: `EDA&Analysis.ipynb`

In this section, I delve into the rich dataset of SEGA games to uncover valuable insights and trends. The EDA and Analysis notebook (`EDA&Analysis.ipynb`) covers the following key areas:

### Frequency Distribution of Genres
I start by examining the distribution of game genres, providing an overview of the most popular genres within the SEGA gaming universe.

### Genres vs. Meta Scores Analysis
I analyze how different genres correlate with Meta Scores, shedding light on which genres tend to receive higher or lower ratings from critics.

### ESRB Rating vs. Scores
I explore the relationship between ESRB ratings and game scores, helping us understand how ratings influence game quality.

### Release Date vs. Scores
A time series analysis is conducted to visualize how game scores have evolved over time, offering insights into trends within the SEGA gaming landscape.

### Correlation Analysis
I calculate and discuss the correlation between Meta Scores and User Scores, providing an understanding of the alignment between critics' and users' opinions.

## 2. Predictive Models

- **File**: `Models.ipynb`

In this section, I venture into predictive modeling, aiming to forecast game scores and ratings. The Predictive Models notebook (`Models.ipynb`) includes the following components:

### Data Preprocessing
I begin by preparing the data for modeling, addressing issues such as missing values and data type conversions to ensure data quality.

### Feature Engineering
Effective feature engineering is crucial. I select and engineer features that significantly impact the performance of predictive models.

### Meta Score Prediction
I construct models to predict Meta Scores, providing insights into how games are likely to be reviewed by professional critics.

### User Score Prediction
I develop models to predict User Scores, reflecting the opinions of gamers themselves.

### Interpretation and Insights
I interpret the results and derive insights into the factors influencing game scores, using visualization tools to convey these findings effectively.
